Ceramic based TBC develops complex cracks during the process of deposition which has significant effect on TBC performance. In this work, we report on a Finite Element Method (FEM) based evaluation of the effect of vertical cracks on stresses in a multi-layer Thermal Barrier Coating system (TBCs). We include the effects of thermal and mechanical property mismatch, thickness of top/intermediate/bond-coats and vertical cracks deliberately introduced in the ceramic top coat of TBC system. We analyze the effect of cracks on thermal mismatch induced stresses and the resulting thermal fracture under tension or compressive stresses. Various different crack geometries corresponding to different vertical crack lengths are modeled in a three dimensional representative volume element (RVE) of the TBC. The effect of the crack geometry viz. crack length, crack spacing and structural boundary conditions on the stress distribution have been examined to gain insight into designing a thermo-structurally reliant TBCs. Moreover, the effect of the interfacial stress and temperature in all ceramics layers are examined to evaluate the structural performance of TBCs with vertical. Also, a comparative study analyzing the effect of vertical cracks in a multi-layer TBCs with and without bond coat is carried out. The mechanical environment is simulated and analyzed here by finite element analysis using commercial software ANSYS. The thermo-mechanical behavior of multi-layer TBC under heat flux as high as 1.5 MW/m2 and pressure of 1.3 bars are investigated, towards finding the optimum parameters for crack geometry in the multi-layer TBCs. It is that a crack spacing of 125 \u03bcm and crack length of 300 \u03bcm is the most optimum for TBCs operational temperatures of 2000K.\n\n\n\nKeywords: Thermal Barrier Coating; Crack; Lanthanum Zirconate; Yttria Stabilized Zirconia; Interface; Bond coat; Finite element analysis (FEA);.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThermal barrier coating (TBC) is an important material component in technology critical applications such as high temperature materials processing machineries, high energy infrastructure and future high speed aerospace transportation[1,2]. Another, prominent application area for TBCs is hypersonic transport, because hypersonic vehicles are exposed to intense, highly localized stagnation point heating and a severe thermal environment. Multiple shocks across the mixed compression air intake reduce the flow speed from hypersonic to supersonic and combustion exposes the scramjet to very high heat flux[3,4]. The wall temperatures of scramjet (propulsion system for hypersonic vehicles) for some designs can rise above 2000K, at such high temperature, strength and toughness of most metals degrades rapidly. This necessitates the use of protective mechanisms namely thermal barrier coatings (TBC) and thermal protection systems (TPS)  which shall reduce the heat flux experienced by hypersonic vehicle structure to protect  from  damage due to melting and from developing high thermal stress [5,6]. Recently, we have reported a multi-layer thermal barrier coating (TBC) system consisting of lanthanum zirconate (LaZr) and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) layers for protecting metallic structure of scramjet engine during hypersonic flights. Experimental investigation of coating Inconel alloy substrate with LaZr has also been carried. But, it was observed that during heat treatment (sintering) of TBCs occurs, vertical cracks are generated due to generation of tensile stress in the TBCs, which has also been reported by Peng et al. [7]. Life prediction of TBC with cracks and fracture mechanics analysis of microcracks in thermally cycled thermal barrier coatings has been investigated by Busso et al [8] and Liu et al [9].\n\nTBC layer are deposited by atmospheric plasma-spraying (APS) under high temperatures and it is inevitable that residual stress will be generated in the coating during this process. These initial machining residual stresses [10, 11] may evolve further and be more complicated when the APS-TBC services in the gas turbines under high temperature condition[12, 13]. The complicated residual stress distributions can result in large deformations and crack nucleation in coatings and, inevitably, severely influence the strength and lead to failure of components.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4813, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f40e96d-ea79-46ce-93cc-9db89e7b1e15": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f40e96d-ea79-46ce-93cc-9db89e7b1e15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4dccbe1-d595-47a2-a50f-8f491ad1692d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "0f79513ac500593a10d48c43987a16d49b5af3e263f44fb4066a6aee7fad07c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c47454da-d28c-403b-9e4c-8603375bf472", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "80636ed6baf8564f2f18eba62a924e45893e6aa76e744a09a04400871d1ef6c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "686cb19f-d19b-4d51-a1e6-a5bd2be44242", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74ca78cd2f980a2f7e9e45f1cfdf603b4abe8e8f37d8e97cc0acc109517d42cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These initial machining residual stresses [10, 11] may evolve further and be more complicated when the APS-TBC services in the gas turbines under high temperature condition[12, 13]. The complicated residual stress distributions can result in large deformations and crack nucleation in coatings and, inevitably, severely influence the strength and lead to failure of components. This necessitates the investigation of stress, strain and effect of crack in TBCs to improve the coating design for suitably modifying the production process and hence increase the TBCs service life.\n\nIt has also been reported that the vertical cracks are beneficial to thermal cycling performance of the coatings as it reduces the strain energy in the coatings[14,15], as well as reduce tendency of the ceramic to crack and buckle[16]. Nakahira et al. have reported vertical microcrack formation in the 2CaO2-SiO2-CaO\u00b7ZrO2 thermal barrier Coatings formed by plasma spraying process [17,18]. \n\nVertical microcracks were deliberately introduced in the ceramic top coat of the plasma-sprayed coatings by Madhwal et al. to relieve thermal mismatch stresses[19].Weber et al. showed that vertical crack is beneficial in LZ TBC application due to enhanced thermo mechanical compliance[20,21]. The LZ based TBCs were deposited using the spray pyrolysis method, and thevertical cracks were introduced by decomposing the metal salt [22]. Moreover, the multilayer coating with vertical cracks was fabricated by the successive deposition and decomposition of multiple thin layers. Heat conductionwas small in this multilayer coating due to the generated cracks, and the thermal durability can be increased due to the increased thermo-mechanical compliance[21]. LZ coating has a lower fracture toughness than 8YSZ[23,24] and this leads to cracking at modest stress levels. 25].\n\nThe performance of commercial TBCs is generally done by air plasma spray (APS) and electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD) methods, which induce different microstructure development leading to different thermo-mechanical properties of the TBC. Through EBPVD columnar microstructure are produced with elongated intercolumnar pores aligned perpendicular to the substrate, increasing the coating\u2019s compliance[26]. However, no reduction in the thermal conductivity of the coating is observed due normal orientation of the EBPVD pores with substrate [27]. APS produces TBCs having \u201csplat\u201d grains with inter-\u201csplat\u201d pores and micro-cracks parallel to the surface of the substrate [28]. Although such orientation of the pores, helps in reducing the thermal conductivity of the layer, but it causes coating spallation [29]. Karger et al. tried to increase the lifetime of TBCs deposited via APS by introducing dense vertical cracks (DVCs) in order to improve the strain tolerance [30]. However, for coatings with a density of less than 88% of theoretical, DVCs do not form and better compliance is obtained at the cost of low thermal conductivity[19].\n\nRecently, nanostructured TBCs have been proposed with superior wear resistance and lower thermal conductivity compared to conventional coatings [31]. However, development of uniform nanostructured TBCs is difficult to achieve with the current commercial deposition methods, which use micrometer range powder particles. Padture et al. utilized solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) technique to deposit nanostructured coatings[32]. SPPS produces low thermal conductivity and more durable coatings with ultra-fine splats, through thickness vertical cracks, embedded un-pyrolized particles, and uniformly dispersed nanopores [33]. Nevertheless, APS, SPPS, and EBPVD technologies are costly as well as complex [34], when equated to affordable wet chemistry deposition methods which facilitate the deposition of doped, multilayered, or graded coatings by utilizing liquid precursors.\n\nAmong wet chemistry deposition methods, spray pyrolysis offers thin or thick films coating deposition by adjusting the process parameters like substrate temperature to tailor the microstructure[35,36]. In particular while depositing thick coatings via spray pyrolysis, cracking occurs during the decomposition of the precursor salts in the deposited coatings and these crack patterns can be engineered to improve their durability under oxidation[37,38].\n\nAlthough the above investigations have carried out rigorous experimental processing and have identified the failure modes under isothermal cyclic tests. However, an in-depth investigation on the effect of cracks in TBCs performance in relevant environment has not been pursued. Thus, there remains little knowledge on the effect of cracks on TBC behaviour under severe heat flux conditions as experienced in scramjet engines, gas turbines and IC engines.", "start_char_idx": 4436, "end_char_idx": 9224, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "686cb19f-d19b-4d51-a1e6-a5bd2be44242": {"__data__": {"id_": "686cb19f-d19b-4d51-a1e6-a5bd2be44242", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4dccbe1-d595-47a2-a50f-8f491ad1692d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "0f79513ac500593a10d48c43987a16d49b5af3e263f44fb4066a6aee7fad07c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f40e96d-ea79-46ce-93cc-9db89e7b1e15", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "fa8b7e977d29d43e58855b77021fe9187fd69038388b9904129c6514edf32cfd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "562f6ce6-2ecc-4722-943b-ecea0bca72a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba27d41729163afaf3ae0a146389f86d3cd259e44793be3c1b947d540f4e533e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Although the above investigations have carried out rigorous experimental processing and have identified the failure modes under isothermal cyclic tests.

The 3D model mesh of the TBC with metal substrate assembly is shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, multiple elements have been placed along the thickness direction to capture the temperature variation across difference material interfaces. Second order elements with mid-side nodes, SOLID90 \u201c3D 20-node thermal solid\u201d and SOLID 186 \u201c3D 20-node hexahedral structural solid\u201d have been used to discretize the structural domain. CONTA174 \u201c3D 8-node surface to-surface contact\u201d elements have been used to take into account contact phenomena between the joined components. The following assumptions have been made in performing finite element analysis:\n\n1) Contacts at all interfaces have been considered as perfect, that is, all the interfaces have been assumed bonded;\n\n 2) All layers are homogeneous and isotropic, there are no defects in each layer, and the interfaces between the two adjacent layers are flat without defects or wave characteristic; \n\n3) The creep and plastic deformation of TBC layers are negligible and have been neglected; \n\n4) All ceramic layers were assumed as linear elastic, crack can be initiated in the coating only when the stress exceeds yield stress, leading to coating failure; \n\n5) The air present in transverse cracks would be at thermal equilibrium with the TBC layer 1 material at time t=0 (start of aero-thermal heating). \n\nTwo different cases have been considered for estimating temperature distribution in the TBC system. First case, convective heat transfer through crack walls has been neglected and in second case, convective heat transfer through crack walls has been modeled.\n\nTransient thermal analysis (15 seconds of transient heating due to shock and hydrocarbon based fuel combustion) has been performed using ANSYS based FEM solver, by solving Equation 1. Wall temperature dependent heat flux has been applied on the exposed surface of ceramic layer1 and radiation boundary condition has been applied with emissivity 0.90 on outer surface of metallic substrate, as shown in Fig. 1. Radiation to ambient (Temperature=226K at 30 km) has been modeled. The initial temperature of the model, namely the temperature at the beginning of exposure, has been assumed to be equal to 300K. Temperature dependent material properties for Lanthanum Zirconate, yttria stabilized zirconia and Nimonic 90 alloy have been used for realistic temperature estimation. Heat flux (1.5 MW/m2) for scramjet 40 has been used as the boundary condition for upper surface of the top coat. \n\nThe temperature obtained from transient heat transfer analysis has been mapped to the mesh of solid domain. The structural analysis has been performed using ANSYS based FEM solver to calculate the stresses, by solving Equation 2. Static structural analysis runs have been carried out with boundary conditions, as shown in Fig. 1. The walls of scramjet experience maximum pressure of 1.3 bars[41], accordingly, P=1.3 bars has been applied on the exposed surface of TBC Layer-1 and the side faces are provided displacement constraints (see Fig. 1). Temperature dependent material properties have been used for thermal and structural analysis for realistic temperature, stress and strain estimation [2].\n\nTable I: TBC system materials and their mechanical properties [2]\n\nTBC Material\n\nThermal expansion coefficient( 10-6 K-1)\n\nShear Modulus\n\n(GPa)\n\nBulk Modulus\n\n(GPa)\n\nYoung\u2019s Modulus\n\n(GPa)\n\nYSZ\n\n11\n\n128\n\n194\n\n315\n\nLaZr\n\n9.7\n\n102\n\n197\n\n260\n\nNimonic-90\n\n12.7\n\n83\n\n-\n\n220\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2.

Results and discussion\n\nThe transient thermal analysis shows that introduction of vertical cracks does not significantly affect the temperature experienced by metallic substrate, when heat transfer through crack walls is ignored (see Fig. 4). This can be explained by the fact that volume of cracks is negligible as compared to overall volume of the multi-layer TBC system. But, there is a slight drop in maximum temperature of the top ceramic layer, which can be attributed to absorption of heat by air present in gaps of vertical cracks. On the other hand, considering heat transfer through transverse cracks clearly increases the maximum temperature experienced by TBC. Importantly, increase in length of crack leads to monotonic rise in maximum temperature experienced by TBC (see Fig. 6). \n\n\n\nFig. 4. Variation of temperature across the thickness of multi-layer thermal barrier coating system (refer Fig. 1) calculated through transient thermal analysis with/without cracks  \n\nThe thermal and structural analysis (CTSA) shows that thickness of ceramic layer-1 and ceramic layer-2 affects the temperatures of TBC system as well as stresses at TBC system interfaces. The stresses and temperatures at each TBC interface reduce by optimizing the thickness of ceramic layer-1 and ceramic layer-2 in previous work. In current work, the effect of various geometric parameters like crack length (L) and crack spacing (s) has been investigated to understand their effect on temperature, overall displacement and stress experienced by TBCs. It has been found that vertical cracks help in reducing interfacial shear stress significantly at all the interfaces.\n\n3.1 Effect of crack (ignoring heat transfer through cracks)\n\nThe effect of transverse cracks on interfacial shear stress has been investigated by introducing cracks of 20 \u03bcm width in the LaZr layer. However, the heat transfer through crack walls has been neglected in these analyses. It is found that introduction of cracks significantly reduces stress at all the interfaces, as summarized in Tables 2-4. This can be explained by the fact that thermal expansion relief is provided by the presence of transverse cracks.  In particular, the interfacial stresses vary non-linearly with crack width (Table 3) and a smaller crack length (300\u00b5m) relieves the stresses better than a full length crack (600\u00b5m) running through the entire thickness of ceramic layer 1 (Table 4).\n\n\n\nTable II: Interfacial stress in MPa with/without vertical cracks ignoring heat transfer through crack\n\nShear stress\n\n (MPa)\n\n\n\nLaZr face\n\n(Interface1)\n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface1)\n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface2 )\n\nSubstrate face\n\n(Interface2)\n\nWithout  Vertical crack\n\n221.5\n\n288\n\n93.7\n\n53.5\n\nWith Vertical crack\n\n153.6\n\n82.1\n\n16.7\n\n71.9\n\nPercentage reduction\n\n76.5%\n\n76.4%\n\n8.5%\n\n49.1%\n\nTable III: Effect of crack width on interfacial stress ignoring heat transfer through crack\n\n Shear stress\n\n(MPa)\n\n\n\nLaZr face\n\n(Interface1)\n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface1)\n\nYSZ face\n\n(YSZ-Metal Interface)\n\nSubstrate face\n\n(YSZ-substrate interface)\n\nMaximum Deformation\n\n(\u00b5m)\n\n10 \u00b5m\n\n107.8\n\n89.9\n\n26.5\n\n\t53.7\n\n\t30.6\n\n15 \u00b5m\n\n70.6\n\n101.6\n\n16.8\n\n66.1\n\n\t31.5\n\n20 \u00b5m\n\n153.6\n\n82.1\n\n16.7\n\n71.9\n\n31.6\n\n\n\n\tTable IV: Effect of crack length on interfacial stress in MPa ignoring heat transfer through crack (crack width=20 \u00b5m)\n\n\t\tCrack length\n\n (\u00b5m)\n\nLaZr face\n\n(Interface1)\n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface1)\n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface2)\n\nSubstrate face\n\n(Interface2)\n\nMaximum Deformation (\u00b5m)\n\n300\n\n31.4\n\n10.5\n\n27.2\n\n\t54.3\n\n\t30.7\n\n600\n\n153.6\n\n82.1\n\n16.7\n\n71.9\n\n31.6", "start_char_idx": 16007, "end_char_idx": 19735, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4ded104-3022-45ca-8e79-d1eebc074945": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4ded104-3022-45ca-8e79-d1eebc074945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a4dccbe1-d595-47a2-a50f-8f491ad1692d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "0f79513ac500593a10d48c43987a16d49b5af3e263f44fb4066a6aee7fad07c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9c5d9fe-e16b-4b79-b67e-894c98bed41f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "b698f87c8e0f2f6da56e4b5c179775820f030388bbd300938bbac7cc597e8536", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "080f3ded-3536-4b99-8169-e5f80a520037", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc38f11912d0c11ef7becd734004deddf7bf3b6f5bbfc1e06924c8d478703897", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "3.2 Effect of crack length (considering heat transfer through cracks)\n\n\tThe boundary conditions play a crucial role in effecting the stress in the layers of thermal barrier coatings. We observed very high stresses of the order of 2-3GPa near crack tip when the faces of TBC layers are not allowed to expand. In this perspective, we have investigated the effect of allowing free thermal expansion of TBC layers with the side faces of metallic substrate fully constrained along all degrees of freedom. The temperature field is not affected by such change in structural boundary conditions, but, the stress field at interfaces of TBC and around crack tip varies significantly. \n\n\tThe increase in crack length produces a monotonic increase in temperature at the various interfaces, as shown in Fig. 5, due to increase in effective surface area available for heat deposition. Similarly, the stress at interface 2 increases monotonically with increase in crack length due to rising temperature at interface 2 (Fig. 6). However, the stress at interface 1 varies non-linearly with crack length. It increases when crack length is increased from 100\u00b5m to 200 \u00b5m. But, drops to 25.4 MPa for 300\u00b5m and then again increases with further increase in crack length (Fig. 6). This can be explained by the fact that increase in crack length increases the heat deposition, but, the vertical cracks have a stress relieving effect as well. Hence, an optimum vertical crack length needs to be selected, while tailoring the crack length during experimental coating/deposition of ceramic layers.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n Fig. 5.

Variation of stress at exposed surface of TBCs and interface 2 of multi-layer thermal barrier coating system (refer Fig. 1) as a function of crack length, calculated through thermo-structural analysis \n\n3.3 Effect of crack spacing (considering heat transfer through cracks) \n\nThe effect of transverse crack spacing on interfacial shear stress has been investigated by introducing variable crack spacing of 50, 75, 100 and 125 \u03bcm in the LaZr layer. The change in crack spacing produces a monotonic decrease in temperature at the various interfaces, as shown in Fig. 7. This can be explained by the fact that the additional heat deposited through crack spreads over a larger material volume with increase in crack spacing. Similarly, the stress at interface 2 decreases monotonically with increase in crack spacing due to decreasing temperature at interface 2. However, the stress at interface 1 varies non-linearly with crack length. It increases when crack spacing is increased from 50\u00b5m to 75 \u00b5m (Fig. 8). But, decreases with further increase in crack spacing. This can be explained by the fact that effect of increased  heat dissipation with increase in crack spacing becomes dominant beyond crack spacing of 75 \u00b5m. Thus, a higher crack spacing has a stress relieving effect. Hence, an optimum vertical crack spacing needs to be selected, while tailoring the space between cracks during experimental coating/deposition of ceramic\n\n \n\n\n\nFig. 7.

Then, another analysis is carried out by introducing a bond coat between ceramic layer-2 and metal substrate to estimate interfacial and stress (Table 6). The introduction of bond coat creates interface 3 between bond coat and substrate faces. It can be clearly seen that temperature at different interfaces does not change significantly by introduction of bond coat, owing to its very small thickness of 50 \u00b5m. However, stresses at interface 1 reduce to half in presence of bond coat. Similarly, stresses at YSZ face of interface 2 reduce to one-third by introduction of bond coat. A comparison of the same has been made as shown in Table VI.  The stresses at YSZ-bond coat interface is higher compared to stress at YSZ-substrate interface, whereas bond coat-substrate interface experiences stresses as high as 450MPa at temperatures of 1100K.\n\nTable V: Proposed TBC system final design with bond coat with a crack spacing of 125 \u03bcm and crack length of 300 \u03bcm\n\nTBC System Component\n\nTemperature\n\nMaterial\n\nMaximum Operational Temperature\n\n\tThickness\n\nTBC Layer-1\n\n1550 K\n\nLaZr\n\nupto 2573 K\n\n0.60 mm\n\nTBC Layer-2\n\n1140 K\n\nYSZ\n\nupto 1523 K\n\n0.15 mm\n\nBond coat\n\n1051 K\n\nCoNiCrAlY\n\nupto 1323 K\n\n0.05mm\n\nMetal substrate\n\n1050K\n\nNimonic-90\n\nupto 1250 K\n\n2.50 mm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable VI: von Mises stress in MPa with bond coat and without bond coat (* interface 2 between YSZ and substrate)\n\nType of TBCs \n\nLaZr face\n\n(Interface1)  \n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface1)\n\n\n\nYSZ face\n\n(Interface2)\n\nBond coat face\n\n  (Interface2)\n\nBond coat face\n\n(Interface3)\n\nSubstrate face\n\n(Interface3) \n\nWith\n\nBond coat\n\n28.2\n\n18.9\n\n25\n\n87.5\n\n450\n\n200\n\nWithout Bond coat\n\n55.9\n\n20.4\n\n78.3\n\n\n\n\n\n90.3*\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t4. Conclusions\t\n\nThe TBC design proposed in this work investigates the effect of transverse cracks on thermo-structural behavior of multi-layer thermal barrier coating. Multiple coupled thermal-structural analyses have been performed by varying parameters pertaining to crack width, length and spacing. Following salient observations have been made in the present work: \n\nThe introduction of cracks helps in relieving interfacial stresses. But, the interfacial stresses vary non-linearly with crack width and a smaller crack length relieves the stresses better than a full length crack , when heat transfer through crack is ignored \n\nCrack length significantly affects interfacial stress values, when heat transfer through crack is considered.  Its effect on different interfaces of multi-layer TBCs is different and hence crack length optimization is required for effective stress management. \n\nCrack spacing of 125 \u00b5m and crack length of 300\u00b5m has been find to be the most optimum crack geometry in present investigation at  TBCs operational temperatures of 2000K. \n\nThe introduction of bond coat in TBCs with crack helps in further reducing the interfacial stresses by 50 percent at interface 1 and 35 percent at interface 2.\n\nIt has been found that transverse cracks help in reducing interfacial stresses marginally and the effect of heat transfer modeling through cracks is essential to accurately estimate the stress and deformation of TBCs. Through rigorous computational investigation, we propose the use of multi-layer TBC system consisting of LaZr, YSZ with carefully tailored vertical cracks for effective protection of metallic airframe. Similar TBC system design can also be adopted for protecting metallic components of space vehicle, engines, gas turbines and rocket nozzles. Further work on the development of the proposed TBC system and its experimental investigation for other high temperature metal is being currently pursued.", "start_char_idx": 22977, "end_char_idx": 27319, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ece500de-1497-44d4-a99a-902dc371f586": {"__data__": {"id_": "ece500de-1497-44d4-a99a-902dc371f586", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15", "entities": ["Eric H.

I would like to state that this manuscript is not published or under review in any other journal.\n\nThe manuscript reports a study on structural behaviour of multi-layer thermal barrier coating with cracks using rigorous Finite element analysis. While there are many reports on development and fabrication of thermal barrier coatings using Air plasma spray, Spray pyrolysis and their experimental characterization. However, an investigation adopting an integrated approach to study the influence of vertical crack in a multi-layer thermal barrier coating is uncommon. Moreover, the present work reveals the effects of crack parameters like crack length and crack spacing on substrate temperature and stresses at different interfaces of multi-layer coating. Also, a comparative study analyzing the effect of vertical cracks in a multi-layer TBCs with and without bond coat is carried out. \n\nThe present work simulates the thermo-mechanical environment using commercial software ANSYS under heat flux and pressure as experienced in high temperature combustion systems like scramjets, towards finding the optimum parameters for crack geometry in the multi-layer TBC. Our analyses show that that a crack spacing of 125 \u03bcm and crack length of 300 \u03bcm is the most optimum for TBC operational temperatures of up to 2000K.\n\nThe current length of the manuscript is close to 7600 words considering all the figures, tables, references. We have broadly reviewed the reported literature on thermal barrier coatings and carefully provided details on computational modeling including mesh convergence studies. This would enable the readers to get a holistic understanding of our work as well help them conceive the comprehensive computational scheme employed in the present work.\n\nHope you will find the manuscript interesting and worth publishing in your esteemed journal.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nAnupam Purwar \n\nCentre of Excellence in Hypersonics\n\nIndian Institute of Science, Bangalore \u2013560012\n\nKarnataka, INDIA.\n\nCorresponding author", "start_char_idx": 35807, "end_char_idx": 38573, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2d462e1-3a7f-4420-80fa-eb0192158ad0": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2d462e1-3a7f-4420-80fa-eb0192158ad0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/conversation_log.csv", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/conversation_log.csv", "file_type": "text/csv", "file_size": 6451, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15", "entities": ["Indian School of Business"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f38f08b3-780c-44c3-b128-8c36fcdcc862", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/conversation_log.csv", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/conversation_log.csv", "file_type": "text/csv", "file_size": 6451, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "0208d534818c399199d9da821f12a76a31b1b8344f2e6e36bdfbd2093915abe9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81851c86-6581-4af7-b140-9441f945a5eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/FEM/Finite element analysis of coating with cracks_v280.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 1897184, "creation_date": "2024-03-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "f899d87032b3a728e1bb1ebb594ce4b82553813af073b7381728a4b0d5fb5b4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e351df5-eb70-420b-8bdf-134ad4956a39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58761900ed1770e3a98e6418c0f1da713d1462d90fe870bf16ade3b7c4b20c2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "0, what is i venture?\n, I-Venture @ ISB is a program that focuses on fostering entrepreneurship and nurturing start-ups at the Indian School of Business (ISB).
