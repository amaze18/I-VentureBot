Parents, other\nclose relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the\ndissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education\nin schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to\nthe young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and\nhaving misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information\nabout reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS ,\netc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to\nlead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people, especially fertile\ncouples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth\ncontrol options, care of pregnant mothers, post -natal care of the mother\nand child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male\nand the female child , etc., would address the importance of bringing up\nsocially conscious healthy famil ies of desired size. Awareness of problems\ndue to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and\nsex-related crimes , etc., need to be created to enable people to think\nand take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a\nsocially responsible and  healthy society.\nSuccessful implementation of various action plans to attain\nreproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional\nexpertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical\nassistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like\npregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems,\ninfertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies\nfrom time to time are also required to provide more efficient care\nand assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis  for\nsex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides,\nmassive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that merit\nmention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid\nof the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved\nsubstances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain\ngenetic disorders such as, down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell\nanemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus.\nResearch on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and\nsupported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out\nnew methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones.

However , incr eased health\nfacilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on\nthe growth of population. The world population which was around\n2 billion (2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion  by 2000 and\n7.2 billion in 2011. A similar trend was observed in India too. Our\npopulation which was approximately 350 million at the time of our\nindependence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed\n1.2 billion in May 2011. A rapid decline in death rate,  maternal mortality\nrate (MMR) and  infant mortality rate  (IMR) as well as an increase in\nnumber of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this.\nThrough our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we\ncould bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal.\nAccording to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was\nless than 2 per cent, i.e., 20/1000/year , a rate at which our population\ncould increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an\nabsolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and\nclothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore,\nthe government was forced to take up serious measures to check this\npopulation growth rate.\nThe most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller\nfamilies by using various contraceptive methods. Y ou might have seen\nadvertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy\ncouple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do  (we two, our\ntwo). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even\nadopted an \u2018one child norm\u2019. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the\nfemale to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to\ncouples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle\nthis problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive\nmethods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies.\nAn ideal contraceptive should be user -friendly, easily available,\neffective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no\nway interfere with the sexual drive, desire and/or the sexual act of the\nuser. A wide range of contraceptive methods ar e presently available which\ncould be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely\nNatural/T raditional, Barrier , IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables,\nImplants and Surgical methods.\nRationalised 2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3081, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bdd6ee6-0d98-4cff-8dd2-3a76e0d6978d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bdd6ee6-0d98-4cff-8dd2-3a76e0d6978d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13", "entities": ["amenorrhea"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a52328e1-19b1-40ec-8f98-b3465a32a401", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13"}, "hash": "6ab810bf37dc72705763cc7f8ae27eabfc4663d16600f64694ddb03c77bc7207", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aeccdb5d-6f7d-4dd2-86eb-7d5a829ac6d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13"}, "hash": "dfa5d5b7ac843e7bdab1cbd721bf0f768e43dbc9346f486ce09bff5da30002ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee4229f1-1649-49f1-9697-c00ca6e9b9f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "98bf8f7143713ea9cd98a8e1ede289e026e489326971de6bc247594d3618affb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "44BIOLOGY\nFigure 3.2. Copper T (CuT)Natural methods  work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum\nand sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which\nthe couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual\ncycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are\nvery high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by\nabstaining from coitus during this period, conception could\nbe prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus  is another\nmethod in which the male partner withdraws his penis from\nthe vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid\ninsemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of\nmenstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation\nand therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of\nintense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long\nas the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of\nconception are almost nil. However , this method has been\nreported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six\nmonths following parturition. As no medicines or devices\nare used in these methods, side effects are almost nil.\nChances of failure, though, of this method are also high.\nIn barrier  methods, ovum and sperms are prevented\nfrom physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such\nmethods  are available for both males and females.\nCondoms  (Figure 3.1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber/\nlatex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or\nvagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that\nthe ejaculated semen would not enter into the female\nreproductive tract. This can prevent conception. \u2018Nirodh\u2019 is\na popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms\nhas increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of\nprotecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS. Both\nthe male and the female condoms are disposable, can be\nself-inserted and ther eby gives privacy to the user .\nDiaphragms, cervical caps  and vaults  are also barriers\nmade of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive\ntract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent\nconception by blocking the entry of sperms through the\ncervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and\nfoams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase\ntheir contraceptive efficiency.\nAnother effective and popular method is the use of \nIntra Uterine\nDevices (IUDs). These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses\nin the uterus through vagina.  These Intra Uterine Devices are presently\navailable as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing\nIUDs (CuT, Cu7, Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs\n(Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 3.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms\nwithin the uterus and the C u ions released suppress sperm motility and\nthe fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs, in addition,\nFigure 3.1(b) Condom for femaleFigure 3.1(a) Condom for male\nRationalised 2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2958, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee4229f1-1649-49f1-9697-c00ca6e9b9f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee4229f1-1649-49f1-9697-c00ca6e9b9f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13", "entities": ["India"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4230beb1-abc9-4861-ac37-4252d4a2e7a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13"}, "hash": "6b584e4d4b9e69230afa310bf7ba0a8b0181bd86ac71f3ac7f8d195f535e347b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bdd6ee6-0d98-4cff-8dd2-3a76e0d6978d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13"}, "hash": "92c642a997c613543a8a768b1e6a52a75752bbcdd796e5cf7b48bf3a49308e30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1e50dbf-06b4-4245-b0c7-2330d4d7c68e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8938c11ebe5bbcbc0e12c5a3df0020fcd63f9c5daec6d6d07193c4a7d6129cfc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "45REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nmake the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the\ncervix hostile to the sperms.

Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby\nprevent conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called \u2018vasectomy\u2019\nand that in the female, \u2018tubectomy\u2019. In vasectomy, a small part of the vas\ndeferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum\n(Figure 3.4a) whereas in tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is\nremoved (Figure 3.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen\nor through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their\nreversibility is very poor .\nIt needs to be emphasised that the selection of a suitable contraceptive\nmethod and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with\nqualified medical professionals. One must also remember that\ncontraceptives are not regular requirements for the maintenance of\nreproductive health. In fact, they are practiced against a natural\nreproductive event, i.e., conception/pregnancy. One is forced to use these\nmethods either to prevent pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy due\nto personal reasons. No doubt, the widespread use of these methods have\na significant r ole in checking uncontr olled gr owth of population. However ,\ntheir possible ill-effects like nausea, abdominal pain, breakthrough\nbleeding, irr egular menstrual bleeding or even br east cancer , though not\nvery significant, should not be totally ignored.\n3.3 M EDICAL  TERMINA TION OF PREGNANCY  (MTP)\nIntentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term is called\nmedical termination  of pregnancy  (MTP) or induced abortion. Nearly\n45 to 50 million MTPs are performed in a year all over the world which\naccounts to 1/5th of the total number of conceived pr egnancies in a year .\nWhether to accept /  legalise MTP or not is being debated upon in many\ncountries due to emotional, ethical, religious and social issues involved\nin it. Government of India legalised MTP in 1971 with some strict conditions\nto avoid its misuse. Such restrictions are all the more important to check\nindiscriminate and illegal female foeticides which are reported to be high\nin India.\nWhy MT P? Obviously the answer i s\u2013to get rid of unwanted\npregnancies either due to casual unprotected intercourse or failure of the\ncontraceptive used during coitus or rapes. MTPs are also essential in\ncertain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or\neven fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both.\nMTPs ar e consider ed relatively safe during the first trimester , i.e., upto\n12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions ar e much mor e riskier .\nOne disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MTPs are performed\nillegally by unqualified quacks which are not only unsafe but could be\nfatal too. Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to\ndetermine the sex of the unborn child.  Frequently, if the foetus is found\nto be female, it is followed by MT P- this is totally against what is legal.The Medical Termination\nof Pregnancy\n(Amendment) Act, 2017\nwas enacted by the\ngovernment of India with\nthe intension of\nreducing the incidence of\nillegal abortion and\nconsequent maternal\nmortality and morbidity.\nAccording to this Act, a\npregnancy may be\nterminated on certain\nconsidered grounds\nwithin the first 12 weeks\nof pregnancy on the\nopinion of one registered\nmedical practitioner . If\nthe pregnancy has lasted\nmore than 12 weeks, but\nfewer than 24 weeks, two\nregistered medical\npractitioners must be of\nthe opinion, formed in\ngood faith, that the\nrequired ground exist.\nThe grounds for such\ntermination of\npregnancies are:\n(i)The continuation of\nthe pregnancy would\ninvolve a risk to the\nlife of the pregnant\nwoman or of grave\ninjury physical or\nmental health; or\n(iiThere is a\nsubstantial risk that\nof the child were\nborn, it would suffer\nfrom such physical\nor mental\nabnormalities as to\nbe seriously\nhandicapped.\nRationalised 2023-24", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3891, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f04ee5f6-6dbd-4b65-8bec-dc94ee0c36a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f04ee5f6-6dbd-4b65-8bec-dc94ee0c36a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13", "entities": ["chlamydiasis", "syphilis"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab0ad1f0-3f93-4554-9526-ad155b6cbe98", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13"}, "hash": "7108fe7f39b0bb4653d4668a167be277ef5f2c9f7b7db02b15002fe00fc6e0da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1e50dbf-06b4-4245-b0c7-2330d4d7c68e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ubuntu/NEET/lebo103.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1274922, "creation_date": "2024-03-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-13"}, "hash": "da6540ebb232ada3b2305695c8631b5d8ff8efe7dce39d67ca6e4414d195fa7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2767b997-7e50-473c-a1af-f703460681bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "78cfb2694f3739042f19e33e95f861c906f67d0fd4ba3e371ab1313e120cfe0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "47REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nSuch practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for\nthe young mother and the foetus.

Gonorr hoea, syphilis,\ngenital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B\nand of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading\nto AIDS are some of the common STIs. Among these, HIV infection is\nmost dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.\nSome of these infections like hepatitis\u2013B and HIV can also be\ntransmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc.,\nwith infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to\nthe foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections,\nother diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated\nproperly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching,\nfluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected\nfemales may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected\nfor long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of\ninfection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected\npersons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could\nlead to complications later , which include pelvic inflammatory diseases\n(PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer\nof the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society.\nTherefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are\ngiven prime consideration under the reproductive health-care\nprogrammes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their\nincidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group\nof 15-24 years \u2013 the age group to which you also belong. There is no\nreason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these\ninfections by following the simple principles given below:\n(i)Avoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners.\n(ii)Always try to use condoms during coitus.\n(iii)In case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early\ndetection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection .\n3.5 I NFERTILITY\nA discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of\ninfertility.

The reasons for this could be man y\u2013physical,\ncongenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological.\nIn India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but\nmore often than not, the problem lies in the male partner . Specialised\nhealth care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and\ncorrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable th ese couples to\nhave childr en. However , wher e such corr ections ar e not possible, the couples\ncould be assisted to have children through certain special techniques\ncommonly known as assisted r eproductive technologies  (ART).\nIn vitro  fertilisation  (IVF\u2013fertilisation outside the body in almost\nsimilar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer  (ET)\nis one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube\nbaby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the\nhusband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under\nsimulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with\nupto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube\n(ZIFT\u2013zygote intra fallopian transfer\n) and embryos with more than\n8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT  \u2013 intra uterine transfer ), to complete\nits further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo  fertilisation  (fusion\nof gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist\nthose females who cannot conceive.\nTransfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube\n(GIFT \u2013 gamete intra fallopian transfer ) of another female who cannot\nproduce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and\nfurther development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic\nsperm injection  (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo\nin the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.\nInfertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate\nthe female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be\ncorrected by artificial insemination  (AI) technique. In this technique,\nthe semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially\nintroduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI \u2013 intra-uterine\ninsemination ) of the female.\nThough options are many, all these techniques require extremely high\nprecision handling by specialised professionals and expensive\ninstrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in\nvery few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable to\nonly a limited number of people.  Emotional, religious and social factors\nare also deterrents in the adoption of these methods.  Since the ultimate\naim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many\norphaned and destitute children, who would probably not survive till\nmaturity, unless taken care of.
